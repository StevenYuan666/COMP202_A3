This is the README file of the assignment 3.
Initially, there is something wrong with my get_candidate_by_place function. I asked this question to professor Giulia and talked the logic with my friend Limerence. Finally, I fixed the problem and get the right plot.
For the fourth part of assignment 3, proportional representation, the random seed given by professor Elizabeth in the guide is wrong. I cannot pass the doctest with that seeds. Consequently, I change it to the right random seed and pass all of the doctest. I believe that the random seed will only affect the result of each function but not how the function run. Hope this make sense. 
I have already commented all of codes in my files, hope those are helpful. Thank you!
