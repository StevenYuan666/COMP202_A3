# Voting System
We had a federal election in 2019! You may have noticed that the party which won (the Liberal Party) was not the same as the party which won the popular vote (the Conservative Party).

This is an artifact of the voting system we use in Canada and is not uncommon. It is one of many reasons many Canadians want electoral reform.

A voting system is an algorithm to pick a winner from a set of votes. Different voting systems can produce different results. The study of voting systems is called voting theory, and is important not just for politics â€” in Artificial Intelligence, computational agents need to be able to make decisions between multiple options. A lot of voting theory research is done by computer scientists.

Here, we implemented six voting systems, and compare how the results of the recent election could be different depending on the system.
